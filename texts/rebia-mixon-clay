00:37 I was pregnant when I met him.
00:40 And he saw me, and walked over towards me, and he said, You're going to be my wife.
00:45 And a year later, we just one day went down to City Hall and got married. 
00:54 And we had no rings. 
00:55 He tried to give me his class ring, a big ugly thing, and put it on my finger. 
01:00 And I was like, Uh-huh. 
01:03 And I remember coming home one day, and he wasn't there. 
01:08 And there was a note on the back of the door. 
01:10 And it said, Go in the bedroom and look on the dresser. 
01:13 And I went in the bedroom and in the front of the dresser, there was the ring box. 
01:19 A beautiful wedding ring and engagement ring. 
01:22 I grabbed those things and I put them on. 
01:25 I just ran out of the house, 'cause I knew where he hung out at. 
01:26 And when he saw me coming, he said, Did you find the note? 
01:35 And I said, Yes, and I was shaking and stuff, like I had just met him. 
01:38 And I handed him the rings and he got down on one knee and said, Will you be my wife, really be my wife? 
01:42 And I said, Yeah.

02:06 I was married to him for seventeen years, and we separated. And he moved to Michigan. 
02:11 I don't know the details, but Frank got into an altercation. 
02:17 They say that this woman was a "damsel in distress." 
02:22 And Frank was helping her. And the woman's boyfriend shot him in the back. 
02:30 I had my fourth child with him and he's exactly like his father. Exactly. 
02:40 He never talks above a whisper. He's always happy and laughing. He's the gentleman of all gentlemen. 
02:49 And you know my other three kids are like that because they had him. 
02:54 My oldest son, he'll tell you, My biological father's name is So-and-so, but my dad's name is Frank Mixon. 
03:02 And out of all the years that we were separated, I still remember Frank Mixon. 
03:10 Because I honestly believe that he was my first true love.
