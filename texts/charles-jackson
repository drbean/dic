Charles on his mom with Alzheimers

A:
00:37 And here Charles remembers the day he found out what was happening to her.
B:
00:41 My brother Stanley and I came home from school.
00:45 And Mom told us that our aunt wanted to talk to us. 
00:50 So we went out and got in the old pick up and drove over there. 
00:55 And my aunt started telling us that Mom had this disease that my aunt Pearl had had and old Fred and so forth down the line. 
01:06 That's the first day I heard the word, Alzheimers. 
01:10 When we got back to the farm it was dark. 
01:13 And Mom and Dad were in a fight. 
01:15 Dad had gotten home from work and wanted to know where we were at. 
01:18 And she had forgotten where we had gone. 
01:21 They were yelling and screaming at each other. 
01:23 And it was a horrible night for all of us. 
01:26 I was the one that became the care person for my mother at that time. 
01:30 I was thirteen. 
01:32 I got to high school. 
01:34 I was in my senior year. 
01:36 And by this time, Mom was sitting in a rocking chair with a blanket wrapped around her, and all the blinds pulled down. 
01:44 That year, she asked me if I could help her die and I told her I couldn't. 
01:50 And after that, she started trying to run away. 
01:52 Any chance that she thought she could sneak out of the house she would leave. 
01:57 And I'd have to go find her. 

Charles' own Alzheimers

02:01 I was diagnosed in 2004 with Alzheimers. 
02:06 I was 50. 
02:07 A friend of mine sent me an email right after my diagnosis. 
02:11 She said, This is terrible. 
02:13 This isn't fair. 
02:14 And this is a horrible thing. 
02:16 And I wrote back to her and I said, Well, it's not that bad. 
02:20 It's not like you're in pain all the time. 
02:24 But, um, it takes a toll on your family, because I know that when they see my failing they get really sad and they don't like to see that. 
02:35 I wish they would try to understand that I may be a little different. 
02:41 There's a time there, where, uh, I will forget everybody's name. 
02:46 But inside, I'm still there. 
02:50 I'm still me. 
02:52 Inside, I'm thinking how much fun I'm having with them. 
02:55 And I, as much as possible, would like to be treated as I have been treated before.
