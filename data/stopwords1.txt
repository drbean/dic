Stop Word List 1

   This stopword list is probably the most widely used stopword list. It covers
   a wide number of stopwords without getting too aggressive and including too
   many words which a user might search upon. This wordlist contains 429 words.


# Freely available stopword list.  This stopword

# list provides a nice balance between coverage
