=head1 NAME

dicDB::Player - A model object representing a dictation text in a competition

=head1 DESCRIPTION

# unclozeables are separated by '|'

This is an object that represents a row in the 'texts' table of your application
database.  It uses DBIx::Class (aka, DBIC) to do ORM.

For Catalyst, this is designed to be used through dic::Model::dicDB.
Offline utilities may wish to use this class directly.
