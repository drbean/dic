A reminder about the exam in Week 13. Be there or lose 10 points.

There is no new homework in the conversation class in Week 13.

Talk to your partners about Jose and his Thanksgiving 
experience, Theresa and her relationship with 
Stephanie and Gus and his escape from Cuba with Ileana.

Do the old homework before the exam.  
Make sure your partners have done the homework.

Listen to the soundfiles again on the Access page
accessible from http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/DictationExercises.html, or
directly at http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/Access.html, 

And try WH-questions on the homework page.
You can now ask WH-questions about Gus and his 
story.

For example:

        "Who looked back?",
        "Which man looked back?",
        "Who raised Ileana?",
        "Which woman raised Ileana?",
        "Who gave the dolls to Ileana?",
        "Who gave some dolls to Ileana?",
        "Which person looked back?",
        "Which woman appreciated Gus?",
        "Which girl appreciated Gus?",
        "Which daughter appreciated Gus?",
        "Who did Ileana appreciate?",
        "Which person did Ileana appreciate?",
        "Which man did Ileana appreciate?",
        "Which woman did Ileana appreciate?",
        "Who did Ileana have?",
        "Who did Fidel disappoint?",
        "Who did Gus's daughter appreciate?",
        "Which man did Gus's daughter appreciate?",
        "Which woman did Gus's daughter appreciate?",
