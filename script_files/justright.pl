Fran: Orlando, definitely. It's more relaxing, and it's cheaper! And it's got lovely beaches.
Sonia: But we always go to the beach. I'd rather do something different this year. Something more interesting. Like a city. Like Seattle.
Fran: There's a problem, then, Sonia.
Sonia: Oh, What's that?
Fran: Because I like beaches. Well, I like beaches better than cities, anyway. And Orlando is sunnier too. And it always rains in Seattle, you know, Sonia.
Sonia: No, it doesn't. And anyway, rain or no rain, there's more to do in Seattle.
Fran: Like what? Museums and things like that? I'd rather stay here in New York!Sonia: Okay then. You go to the beach and I'll go to Seattle. How's that?
Fran: Oh, all right. You win. This time. But no museums and no walking around in the rain!
