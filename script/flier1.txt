There was no class in Week 1.

I have put the homework up for Week 1 at http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/DictationExercises.html.

Please try to do it before the class in Week 2, this Thursday, that is tomorrow.

The deadline to finish the homework is Saturday morning, March 9 at the end of Week 2.
I will grade it on Saturday afternoon.
