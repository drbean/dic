Rules for expert contestants who want to help a friend.

DON'T LOOK AT YOUR FRIEND'S SCREEN.

If a BLIND person, couldn't do it, DON'T DO IT.

This is a listening activity, not a reading activity.

I know you have an overwhelming urge to look at the screen, when your friend wants your help, BUT DON'T DO IT.

If you can't do it just by talking to your friend, then DON'T DO IT.

If your friend isn't learning how to pronounce the word or sentence in a way
that will allow them to be understood, then this is a wasted opportunity.

Please make your friend's lack of knowledge of the word a teachable moment.

Give your friend a fish and feed him for a day.
Teach him how to fish and feed him for a lifetime.
